# TIC-TAC-TOE-AI
This project implements an AI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm. A human player competes against an intelligent AI that analyzes all possible moves and never loses. The project demonstrates basic game theory, search algorithms, and AI decision-making in a simple Python program.
